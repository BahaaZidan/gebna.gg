title: Floating Toolbar Using Tailwind
description: Toasts or toast messages is a UI pattern that exists on most apps outthere. When we mention toasts in the web, the first instinct of most people is usually to reach for a library or an external package. I'm here to say that it's quite trivial to implement toasts in your web app.

Here's a small tip. If you find yourself needing to implement a floating toolbar, try the following set of Taiwind classes:

```html
<div class="fixed bottom-8 left-1/2 z-50 -translate-x-1/2 transform">
  <your-content></your-content>
</div>
```

This will fix the div in the bottom center of the screen. This is also responsive and will maintain it's relative position when the user is resizing.
