Today I'm showcasing [unplugin-icons](https://github.com/unplugin/unplugin-icons). An amazing library that basically solved the icon problem for me. Here's a feature list from their README:

## Features

- üåè Universal
  - ü§π **Any** icon sets - ~150 popular sets with over 200,000 icons, logos, emojis, etc. Powered by [Iconify](https://github.com/iconify/iconify).
  - üì¶ **Major** build tools - Vite, Webpack, Rollup, Nuxt, Rspack, etc. Powered by [unplugin](https://github.com/unjs/unplugin).
  - üöÄ **Major** frameworks - Vanilla, Web Components, React, Vue 3, Vue 2, Solid, Svelte, and more. [Contribute](./src/core/compilers).
  - üç± **Any** combinations of them!
- ‚òÅÔ∏è On-demand - Only bundle the icons you really use, while having all the options.
- üñ® SSR / SSG friendly - Ship the icons with your page, no more FOUC.
- üåà Stylable - Change size, color, or even add animations as you would with styles and classes.
- üì• [Custom icons](#custom-icons) - load your custom icons to get universal integrations at ease.
- üì≤ [Auto Importing](#auto-importing) - Use icons as components directly in your template.

## Usage (React)

```tsx
import IconAccessibility from "~icons/carbon/accessibility";
import IconAccountBox from "~icons/mdi/account-box";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <IconAccessibility />
      <IconAccountBox style={{ fontSize: "2em", color: "red" }} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Installation

Since it's framework agnostic, I'm not gonna be listing all the different ways you can get it to work in your framework of choice. I'll only show how I got it to work in SvelteKit

Install unplugin-icon

```bash
pnpm add -D unplugin-icons
```

Either install the full iconify pack or your icon pack of choice. I'll install the tabler pack:

```bash
pnpm add @iconify-json/tabler
```

In your `vite.config.ts`:

```ts {8-10}
import { sveltekit } from "@sveltejs/kit/vite";
import { defineConfig } from "vitest/config";
import Icons from "unplugin-icons/vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    sveltekit(),
    Icons({
      compiler: "svelte",
    }),
  ],
});
```

Finally, in your `src/app.d.ts` file:

```ts {1, 7}
import "unplugin-icons/types/svelte";

declare global {
  namespace App {}
}

export {};
```

And that's it! Now you can import the icons across your SvelteKit project with ease:

```svelte {2-3, 7, 11}
<script>
  import GoogleIcon from "virtual:icons/tabler/brand-google-filled";
  import GitHubIcon from "virtual:icons/tabler/brand-github-filled";
</script>

<button class="btn btn-error btn-active text-white">
  <GoogleIcon width={32} height={32} />
  Google
</button>
<button class="btn btn-neutral btn-active">
  <GitHubIcon width={32} height={32} />
  GitHub
</button>
```

_As you can see, you can also style them because at runtime it's just an svg._
