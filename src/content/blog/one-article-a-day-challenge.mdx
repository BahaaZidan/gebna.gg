title: One Article a Day Challenge
description: For most people this article will sound very basic or obvious. That's because it is. These rules are not new revelations. They only serve as a memento to me and to my fellow engineers who wish to stay sane in this mad line of work.

Writing is something I really enjoy. But waiting for the perfect idea and the perfect article made it almost impossible for me to maintain the hobby and paradoxically led to less and less of these perfect ideas. Turns out the less you do something the worse you become at it and vice versa.

So I have decided to challenge myself and write one blogpost every day for the next 30 days. I'm not gonna try to make it perfect. The only criteria is the article's usefulness.
