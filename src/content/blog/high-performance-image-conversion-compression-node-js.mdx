title: 'Sharp: High Performance Image Conversion & Compression in NodeJS'
description: Showcasing Sharp. The typical use case for this high speed Node-API module is to convert large images in common formats to smaller, web-friendly JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF and AVIF images of varying dimensions.

Turns out the best way to make an image compression library in JavaScript is to write it in C.

[Sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) is just that. It doesn't just handle compression or format conversion. The official docs state the use cases clearly:

> The typical use case for this high speed Node-API module is to convert large images in common formats to smaller, web-friendly JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF and AVIF images of varying dimensions.
>
> It can be used with all JavaScript runtimes that provide support for Node-API v9, including Node.js >= 18.17.0, Deno and Bun.
>
> Resizing an image is typically 4x-5x faster than using the quickest ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick settings due to its use of [libvips](https://github.com/libvips/libvips).
>
> Colour spaces, embedded ICC profiles and alpha transparency channels are all handled correctly. Lanczos resampling ensures quality is not sacrificed for speed.
>
> As well as image resizing, operations such as rotation, extraction, compositing and gamma correction are available.

Here's how easy it is to convert image format from `jpg` images to `webp`:

```ts
import sharp from 'sharp';

await sharp(inputPath).webp({ quality: 50 }).toFile(webpPath);
```

That's it. Super straight forward. I've used this library in many contexts. Whether it's compressing user generated images to store them into an S3 bucket or writing a script to compress and resize the images of this blog, Sharp handles it all like a champ. It really is an amazing library and I implore you to [read the docs](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/).
