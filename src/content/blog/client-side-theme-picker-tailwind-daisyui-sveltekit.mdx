One of the great things about DaisyUI is that it offers more than [35 built-in themes](https://daisyui.com/docs/themes/#list-of-themes). Today, we're going to implement a very simple theme changer.

First lets enable the DaisyUI themes we want:

```css title="app.css" {4-6, 9-10}
@import 'tailwindcss';

@plugin "daisyui" {
	themes:
		business --default,
		corporate;
}

@custom-variant theme-business (&:where([data-theme=business], [data-theme=business] *));
@custom-variant theme-corporate (&:where([data-theme=corporate], [data-theme=corporate] *));
```

_I'm assiging a [Tailwind custom variant](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles#adding-custom-variants) to every theme so that we can easily style based on them later_

Install `theme-change`:

```bash
pnpm add theme-change
```

In your root layout, initialize `themeChange`:

```svelte title="src/routes/+layout.svelte" {4-5, 9-11}
<script lang="ts">
	import '../app.css';

	import { onMount } from 'svelte';
	import { themeChange } from 'theme-change';

	let { children } = $props();

	onMount(() => {
		themeChange(false);
	});
</script>

{@render children()}
```

Anywhere in the app you wish to allow your user to change themes:

```svelte
<button
	data-set-theme="corporate"
	data-act-class="ACTIVECLASS"
	class="btn btn-ghost btn-circle theme-corporate:hidden"
>
	<SunIcon />
</button>
<button
	data-set-theme="business"
	data-act-class="ACTIVECLASS"
	class="btn btn-ghost btn-circle theme-business:hidden"
>
	<MoonIcon />
</button>
```

And that's it. You can add as many DaisyUI themes as you'd like.
