A few days ago I switched from using Cloudflare Web Analytics to Umami. You can read about it [here](https://gebna.gg/blog/replaced-cloudflare-analytics-with-umami). My experience so far has been nothing short of incredible. At first I thought Umami was just a simple tool capable of simple things like logging visitors. Now I know that Umami is a simple tool capable of really powerful stuff.

While reading the docs I discovered that Umami can log **Events**. An event can be a user click, a scroll, or anything you want.

Simple events like clicks on buttons or links can be achieved with a simple data attribute:

```html /data-umami-event="Buy Me a Coffee Link"/
<a href="/support" class="link" data-umami-event="Buy Me a Coffee Link">
  Buy me a coffee
</a>
```

You can also add payload to the event not just a name:

```html {5-6}
<a
  href="/support"
  class="link"
  data-umami-event="Buy Me a Coffee Link"
  data-umami-event-email="bob@aol.com"
  data-umami-event-id="123"
>
  Buy me a coffee
</a>
```

Here's a screenshot from my Umami dashboard:

You don't have to use data attributes. You can also use JavaScript to listen or emit events to Umami:

```js
const button = document.getElementById("signup-button");
button.onclick = () => umami.track("Signup button");
```

This is so powerful. Especially for a static website like this blog. It gives me all the insight I need regarding user behaviour. Long live open-source.
