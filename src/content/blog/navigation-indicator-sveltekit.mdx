title: Build a Navigation Indicator in SvelteKit
description: Showcasing the navigating reactive value that comes built into SvelteKit

This little progress indicator that appears while navigating websites like GitHub or Youtube is one of my absolute favorite features. This feature can't really be implemented in a purely server-rendered website.

In SvelteKit, only the first page the user runs into is server-rendered. Kit's client-side router takes over right after that. Giving us the performance and maintainability of SSR with the app-like user experience of SPA. The client-side router also gives us the ability to subscribe to history changes / user navigation and potentially react to it. All we need is the built-in `navigating` reactive value.

In the page/layout you'd want to react to the changes in navigation. I'll do it in my root `+layout.svelte` file:

```svelte {4, 9-11}
<script lang="ts">
  import "../app.css";

  import { navigating } from "$app/state";

  let { children } = $props();
</script>

{#if navigating.from}
  <progress class="progress"></progress>
{/if}

{@render children()}
```

> `navigating` is a read-only object representing an in-progress navigation, with `from`, `to`, `type` and (if `type === 'popstate'`) `delta` properties. Values are `null` when no navigation is occurring, or during server rendering.

Here I'm just rendering a progress html element at the top of every page in my app. I'm using [DaisyUI's progress](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/$app-state#navigating) utility class to style it. Feel free to use whatever you want. It looks like the GitHub/Youtube navigation thingy so I used it. ðŸ‘‡

<progress class="progress"></progress>
