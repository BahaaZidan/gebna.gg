I just [found out](https://youtu.be/UbhhJWV3bmI) that I've been implementing protected routes wrong in my SvelteKit apps. Like many people, I assumed a certain hierarchy to the execution of load functions. That is to say I thought that if a load function in `+layout.server.ts` returns an error, it will short circuit preventing the rest of the load functions _down the hierarchy_ from even running. I was wrong.

In SvelteKit, `load` functions [run in parallel](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/load#Parallel-loading). That's great for performance. Also very counterintuitive. Turns out there is no hierarchy. So what do we do ?

## The Solution

There is one function that always runs **before** all the load functions or even the form actions. It's the [handle](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/hooks#Server-hooks-handle) function in `hooks.server.ts`. We can protect our routes there.

```ts {12-13}
import { redirect } from '@sveltejs/kit';
import { svelteKitHandler } from 'better-auth/svelte-kit';

import { auth } from '$lib/server/auth';

export async function handle({ event, resolve }) {
	const session = await auth.api.getSession({
		headers: event.request.headers,
	});
	event.locals.session = session;

	if (event.url.pathname.includes('admin') && !session?.user) throw redirect(303, '/');

	return svelteKitHandler({ event, resolve, auth });
}
```

## What about parent data?

Since SvelteKit allows us to [use parent data](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/load#Using-parent-data), why don't we just add `await event.parent` in the beginning of any load function we want to protect ?

That will create the waterfall of requests that SvelteKit was trying to protect us from. It also makes the code quite difficult to reason about. So I recommend the hooks based [solution](#the-solution).
