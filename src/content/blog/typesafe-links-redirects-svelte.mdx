One of the great features of SvelteKit is its phenomenal built-in routing and data loading capabilities. But as the number of pages and forms grows in your app, making refactors or changes to a page or even a layout might introduce some runtime bugs. That is because SvelteKit doesn't provide any way to check if an `href` in an anchor tag or a url value in a `redirect` is valid. We need a way to guarantee that all our links, redirects, and even form actions are valid at compile time.

Introducing [vite-plugin-kit-routes](https://www.kitql.dev/docs/tools/06_vite-plugin-kit-routes)

A Vite plugin that generates a typesafe function for routes and form actions.

## Installation

```bash
npm i -D vite-plugin-kit-routes
```

In your `vite.config.ts`:

```ts {3, 8}
import { sveltekit } from "@sveltejs/kit/vite";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { kitRoutes } from "vite-plugin-kit-routes";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    sveltekit(),
    kitRoutes({ generated_file_path: "src/lib/__generated__/routes.ts" }),
  ],
});
```

## Results

Now in all of your anchor tags, redirects, and even form actions, replace strings with invocations of the `route` function exported from `$lib/__generated__/routes.ts`:
