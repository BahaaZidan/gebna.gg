A static blog powered by MDX, built entirely in SvelteKit without the need for Astro or mdsvex. Read more about it [`here`](https://gebna.gg/blog/blog-from-scratch-using-sveltekit).

## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `pnpm install`, start a development server:

```bash
pnpm dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm preview`.
